xSGE is a collection of extra modules for the SGE Game Engine.

xSGE is under the GNU General Public License, so only software under a
GPL-compatible license is permitted to use it.

INSTALLATION

First, make sure you have an appropriate Python version.  This version
of xSGE needs Python 3, version 3.1 or later.  Python 2 and Python 3 are
incompatible, so make sure you use the right one.

xSGE needs a copy of the SGE to work.  If you don't have the SGE
installed already, you can obtain it here:

http://stellarengine.nongnu.org

This version of xSGE needs version 0.11 of the SGE.

Once the SGE is installed, you can install xSGE with the included
setup.py script, e.g.:

    ./setup.py install

USAGE

The documentation for xSGE can be found in the "doc" folder.
