========================================================================

0.7.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugfixes:
- Delta timing causing objects to get stuck at intersections of paths.


0.7
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc changes:
* Updated docstrings to stop referencing old directional collision events.
* xsge.path.Path's acceleration and deceleration can now work with delta
  timing properly.
* xsge.physics collision methods now have a "move_loss" attribute,
  indicating how much movement was lost as a result of the collision.
  (Only applies to Collider objects; MobileWall objects don't lose
  movement as a result of collision, so they don't have the new attribute.)

Bugfixes:
- Positioning of tiles that were a different size than the tileset being wrong


0.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions:
+ xsge.gui.Window.event_joystick_axis_move
+ xsge.gui.Window.event_joystick_hat_move
+ xsge.gui.Window.event_joystick_trackball_move
+ xsge.gui.Window.event_joystick_button_press
+ xsge.gui.Window.event_joystick_button_release
+ xsge.gui.Window.event_global_joystick_axis_move
+ xsge.gui.Window.event_global_joystick_hat_move
+ xsge.gui.Window.event_global_joystick_trackball_move
+ xsge.gui.Window.event_global_joystick_button_press
+ xsge.gui.Window.event_global_joystick_button_release
+ xsge.gui.Widget.event_joystick_axis_move
+ xsge.gui.Widget.event_joystick_hat_move
+ xsge.gui.Widget.event_joystick_trackball_move
+ xsge.gui.Widget.event_joystick_button_press
+ xsge.gui.Widget.event_joystick_button_release
+ xsge.gui.Widget.event_global_joystick_axis_move
+ xsge.gui.Widget.event_global_joystick_hat_move
+ xsge.gui.Widget.event_global_joystick_trackball_move
+ xsge.gui.Widget.event_global_joystick_button_press
+ xsge.gui.Widget.event_global_joystick_button_release
+ xsge.gui.MenuItem
+ xsge.gui.MenuWindow
+ xsge.gui.MenuDialog
+ xsge.gui.get_menu_selection
+ xsge.lighting

Misc changes:
* Methods checking whether a collider is touching walls now return a
  list of such walls, rather than just returning True or False.  Less
  efficient, but more useful.
* Modal dialogs now project screenshots of what came before them, to
  preserve projections that were there at the time.
* When no xsge.gui window has keyboard focus, the topmost window
  automatically gains keyboard focus.

Bugfixes:
- Tab key deselecting everything when reaching the end in xsge.gui
- Borderless windows being offset by the border size
- Crash when following a path


0.5.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc changes:
* Tile objects now take properties from the appropriate tiles and tilesets.
* Paths now support all sge.Object constructor arguments.

Bugfixes:
- Assumption that all tilesets have an image (image sequences don't)
- Use of square brackets where there should have been a function call


0.5.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc changes:
* Pay attention to tile properties

Bugfixes:
- Tileset name and properties being ignored
- Z-axis value not being appropriately set for the layer


0.5.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc changes:
* Map properties are now passed as keyword arguments to the creation of
  the room, rather than ignored.

Bugfixes:
- Fatal typo in class definitions for xsge.tmx


0.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions:
+ xsge.physics.MobileWall
+ xsge.tmx
+ xsge.path

Misc changes:
* "xsticky" and "ysticky" class attributes of slopes renamed to be more
  specific and prevent name conflicts.
* xsge.physics collision events are now special "event_physics_collision"
  events, rather than just being the regular SGE collision events.
* Slope collisions now happen before wall collisions (preventing some
  bad behavior).
* Objects now move along slopes at the speed that they should, rather
  than maintaining the same x or y velocity (and therefore zipping at
  high speed through slopes), by default.

Bugfixes:
- Incorrect behavior with slope stickiness (prevented it from doing its
  job and caused other side effects)
- Collision events in xsge.physics occurring with walls that were *behind*
  the wall that was collided with
- Getting stuck to slopes without actually touching them


0.4
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions:
+ xsge.physics

Removals:
- xsge.transition

Misc changes:
* Made Six an external dependency.


0.3.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions:
+ "default" argument for xsge.gui message boxes

Misc changes:
* Arguments for xsge.gui message boxes and text entry dialogs reordered.
* Height for dialog boxes can be set to None to size automatically.
* Python 2 compatibility is now better and more explicit.

Bugfixes:
- Incomplete __all__ specification in xsge.gui


0.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc changes:
* Arguments for xsge.gui.show_message and xsge.gui.get_text_entry reordered.
* Setting ``parent`` in xsge.gui.show_message and
  xsge.gui.get_text_entry to None now creates a handler automatically.
  This is now the default value of ``parent``.


0.1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

First release, containing xsge.gui and xsge.transition.
