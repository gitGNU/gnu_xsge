========================================================================

1.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc changes:
* Updated to support the latest TMX features.
* The conventions for assigning class based on tileset are now given a
  higher priority than the ones for assigning class based on layer
  names.


0.10.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc changes:
* Changed to use xsge.gfx.TileGrid objects.  This way is slightly faster
  and uses substantially less RAM.


0.10
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc changes:
* Added use of tile object sizes.
* Added use of layer offsets.
* Updated to SGE 0.23.


0.9.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugfixes:
- Failure to properly adjust for changes to tilesets


0.9.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugfixes:
- Wrong handling of the map render order attribute


0.9
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc changes:
* Unmoving, not animated decoration objects are now combined into one
  very large object. This is MUCH more efficient than having hundreds or
  even thousands of small objects.

Bugfixes:
- References to "xsge.tmx" remaining in the documentation


0.8
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc changes:
* Renamed from xsge.tmx to xsge_tmx.


0.7
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugfixes:
- Positioning of tiles that were a different size than the tileset being wrong


0.5.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc changes:
* Tile objects now take properties from the appropriate tiles and tilesets.

Bugfixes:
- Assumption that all tilesets have an image (image sequences don't)
- Use of square brackets where there should have been a function call


0.5.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc changes:
* Pay attention to tile properties

Bugfixes:
- Tileset name and properties being ignored
- Z-axis value not being appropriately set for the layer


0.5.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc changes:
* Map properties are now passed as keyword arguments to the creation of
  the room, rather than ignored.

Bugfixes:
- Fatal typo in class definitions for xsge.tmx


0.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------

First release.
