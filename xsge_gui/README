xSGE is a collection of extensions for the SGE licensed under the GNU
General Public License.  They are designed to give additional features
to free/libre software games which aren't necessary, but are nice to
have.

xSGE extensions are not dependent on any particular SGE implementation.
They should work with any implementation that follows the specification.

This extension provides a simple toolkit for adding GUIs to a SGE game
as well as support for modal dialog boxes.

INSTALLATION

First, install the dependencies:

- Python 2 (2.7 or later) or 3 (3.1 or later) <http://www.python.org>
- SGE Game Engine 0.23 or later <http://stellarengine.nongnu.org>
- Six 1.4.0 or later <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six>

Once you have all the dependencies, install this package with the
included setup.py script, e.g. with "python setup.py install".

Alternatively, you can just place the "xsge_gui" folder into the same
directory as the Python program that uses it. This can be a good idea
for the distribution of a game, since it reduces the number of
dependencies the user needs to install.

USAGE

The documentation for xSGE can be found in the "doc" folder.
