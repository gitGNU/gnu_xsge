This is an explanation of the xSGE's version numbering, in particular
how it indicates compatibility between various xSGE releases.

xSGE version numbers have two or three components.  The components are
the major version, the minor version, and the release version.

Two versions of xSGE with different major versions can be expected to be
incompatible.  For example, there is no guarantee that a program
designed for version 1.0 of xSGE will work on version 2.0 of xSGE.

A version of xSGE with the same major version number, but a higher minor
version number, than another version of xSGE can be assumed to be
backward-compatible.  This number is used to indicate things like
unintrusive feature additions and module additions.  For example, it can
be expected that a program designed for version 1.0 of xSGE will work
with version 1.1 of xSGE.

As a special exception, two versions of xSGE with the major version
number 0, but a different minor version number, can be expected to be
incompatible (i.e. the minor version number is treated as the major
version number).  The major version number 0 is to be used until xSGE
is reasonably complete.

The release version is used to indicate very small changes, such as
bugfixes.  In general, this should never break compatibility, unless a
program was depending on a bug in xSGE.
